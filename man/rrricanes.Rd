\description{
rrricanes is a web-scraping library for R designed to deliver
hurricane data (past and current) into well-organized datasets. With these
datasets you can explore past hurricane tracks, forecasts and structure
elements.

Text products (Forecast/Advisory, Public Advisory, Discussions and
Probabilities) are only available from 1998 to current. An effort will be
made to add prior data as available.
}
\section{Getting Storms}{

List all storms that have developed by year and basin. Year must be in a
four-digit format (\%Y) and no earlier than 1998. Basin can be one or both
of Atlantic ("AL") or East Pacific ("EP").
\describe{
  \item{\code{\link{get_storms}}}{List all storms by year, basin}
}
}

\section{Getting Storm Data}{


\code{\link{get_storm_data}} can be used to select multiple products,
multiple storms and from multiple basins. You can also use
\code{\link{get_fstadv}} for Forecast/Advisory products,
\code{\link{get_wndprb}} for Wind Speed Probabilities (cyclones >= 2006; for
cyclones <= 2005 use \code{\link{get_prblty}}).

Additional text products are:
\describe{
  \item{\code{\link{get_discus}}}{Storm Discussions}
  \item{\code{\link{get_posest}}}{Position Estimates. Rare and used generally
    for threatening cyclones.}
  \item{\code{\link{get_public}}}{Public Advisory. General non-structured
    information exists in these products.}
  \item{\code{\link{get_update}}}{Updates. Generally issued when a cyclone
    undergoes a sudden change that requires immediate notice.}
}

The products above may take some time to load if the NHC website is slow (as
is often the case, unfortunately). You can access post-scraped datasets with
\code{\link{load_storm_data}}. Currently only annual summaries,
forecast/advisory, strike probabilities and wind speed probability products
exist. As of this writing it is up-to-date but caution is advised for active
cyclones. Use the above functions for the most up-to-date data as a fallback.
}

\section{Package Options}{


\code{dplyr.show_progress} displays the dplyr progress bar when scraping raw
product datasets. In \code{\link{get_storms}}, it is based on the number of
years being requested. In the product functions (i.e.,
\code{\link{get_fstadv}}) it is based on the number of advisories. It can be
misleading when calling \code{\link{get_storm_data}} because it shows the
progress of working through a storm's product advisories but will reset on
new products/storms.

\code{rrricanes.working_msg} is set to FALSE by default. When TRUE, it will
list the current storm, advisory and date being worked.

\code{rrricanes.http_timeout} will set a timeout value in seconds. Often
when scraping raw datasets the connection may time out. Use this option if
this becomes an issue.

\code{rrricanes.http_attempts} will control the maximum number of attempts to
get a dataset. Default is 3 but no more than 5 attempts are permitted. If
\code{rrricanes.http_timeout} is reached, `rrricanes` will reattempt until
the value of \code{rrricanes.http_attempts} is reached.

\code{rrricanes.http_sleep} controls how long to wait between multiple
attempts. Default is 3 seconds.
