# rrricanes

`rrricanes` is a R library that extracts information from available archives on past and current tropical cyclones. Currently, archives date back to 1998. This is considered "raw data" in the sense that information extracted is from then real-time advisories. 

Data can be obtained for cyclones in the north Atlantic (considered the Atlantic Basin) and north-eastern Pacific (the East Pacific Basin from 140&deg;W and eastward, and Central Pacific Basin from 140&deg;W to 180&deg;W). 

## Getting Started

Please view the vignette 'Getting Started':

```r
vignette("getting_started", package = "rrricanes")
```

To obtain and view GIS data, see vignette:

```r
vignette("gis_data", package = "rrricanes")
```

### Prerequisites

`rrricanes` only requires an active internet connection as data is extracted from online archives. 

### Installing

`rrricanes` is currently only available in GitHub. It can be installed using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github("timtrice/rrricanes")
```
